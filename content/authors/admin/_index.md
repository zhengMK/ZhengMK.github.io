Hi, there! I am Mingkai Zheng, an incoming M.Eng. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). 

I have participated in some research projects related to power electronics, especially in Dual-Active-Bridge (DAB) DC-DC Converter. Though this might be a minor research direction, still, I believe the accumulated research experience will be helpful for my future research projects, whether I choose to persist in this field or not.

Now, after attending some inspiring online open-source courses, including [CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture](https://cs61c.org/su20/) provided by UC Berkeley, [Computer Architecture on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch?) provided by Prof. David Wentzlaff from Princeton University, and [6.s081: Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/) provided by MIT, I found myself deeply attracted by computer engineering. Therefore, I'd like to investigate deeper into this field through my master's project and continue conducting research projects for my Ph.D. degree. 

:Glowing Star: **I am now actively looking for a Ph.D. position in computer architecture**.
