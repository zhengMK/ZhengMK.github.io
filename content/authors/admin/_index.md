Hi, there! I am Mingkai Zheng. I am a member of [the learning (scalable computing intelligence) group](https://learning-tacc.github.io/) in the Data Intensive Computing Group at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Most of my works are related to HPC and DL. 

Before joining TACC, I received my Master of Engineering degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and my Bachelor of Engineering degree from University of Liverpool.
