Hi, there! I am Mingkai Zheng, an incoming M.Eng. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). 

I have participated in some research projects related to power electronics, especially in Dual-Active-Bridge (DAB) DC-DC Converter. Though this might be a minor research direction, still, I believe the accumulated research experience will be helpful for my future research projects, whether I choose to persist in this field or not.

Now, after attending some inspiring open-source courses, including [CS61B: Data Structure and Algorithms](https://sp19.datastructur.es/) and [CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture](https://cs61c.org/su20/) provided by UC Berkeley, and [6.s081: Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/) provided by MIT, I found myself deeply attracted by computer engineering. Therefore, I'd like to investigate deeper into this field through my master's project and continue learning knowledge related to computer architecture and FPGA accelerators in industry. 

ðŸŒŸ **I am now actively looking for a job in computer architecture and FPGA design**.
