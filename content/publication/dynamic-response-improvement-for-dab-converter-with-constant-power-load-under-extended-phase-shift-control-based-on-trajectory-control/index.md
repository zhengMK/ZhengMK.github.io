abstract: Microgrid has been regarded by many researchers as the fundamental
  building block for the next generation power grid, where DC-DC converter plays
  a crucial role as the interface between main DC bus, energy generation
  facilities, and energy storage systems. Among many different topologies of
  DC-DC converters, bidirectional isolated dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter
  receives increasingly more attentions because of its many merits, including
  allowance on bidirectional power flow, isolation between power supply and
  load, and voltage level conversion. However, as the control scheme used to
  regulate DAB converter evolves, its output voltage and current could be
  roughly regarded as constant, which implies the converter actually feeds a
  constant power load (CPL). Nevertheless, because of its equivalent negative
  resistance effect, CPL could introduce instability to the system, causing
  output power to oscillate or drops to zero. This paper comprehensively
  explains the impact of this negative resistance effect, and, to cope with this
  problem, a nonlinear control method called trajectory control based on the
  natural switching surfaces (NSS) of DAB converter with extended-phase-shift
  (EPS) control will be derived. To better demonstrate the advantages of using
  trajectory control, a traditional linear controller, PI controller, is
  implemented as a comparison. Finally, by comparing the simulation results
  between traditional PI control and trajectory control, it is found that the
  start-up stage for trajectory control is much shorter than that of PI control,
  and the system stability of DAB converter feeding CPL is improved.
