abstract: This paper analysed the trajectory control (TC) based on natural
  switching surface (NSS) in dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter. Which
  improves the fast transition process when load changes from constant resistor
  (CR) to constant power (CP). In order to obtain the NSS based state
  trajectory, the state-space equation is derived mathematically based on the
  small-signal model of DAB converter. Under the TC, the DAB can both achieve
  the constant power load (CPL) stability and fast start-up stage
  simultaneously. Finally, the comparison of open-loop control, closed-loop with
  linear controller and TC are given to validate the effectiveness of the
  proposed strategy.
