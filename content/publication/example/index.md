abstract: This paper proposes a simple and fast fault diagnosis strategy for
  bidirectional isolated dual-active-bridge dc-dc converter with the
  extended-phase-shift control to improve reliability. The fault diagnosis
  strategy utilizes the average values of the voltage to quickly identify
  failures position and devices in either transistors or diodes without adding
  any hardware cost. First, two conditions are classified according to the
  direction of the inductor current on the primary side. Then, a comprehensive
  operation analysis during normal and faulty conditions is presented. Based on
  the characterization of open-circuit faults in diodes and transistors, open
  circuit faults diagnose strategy is derived and validated through both
  simulation and experimental test for different fault conditions.
